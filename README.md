# **This is the second project done by Samaneh Razmi (Sama_Flower).**

## Project Overview

**This project is about E-Commerce site, especially phone E-Commerce. Anyway, you can expand it to anything you want.**

Unfortunately, my default group (group 7) did not cooperate, and I completed the project independently using previous information and course materials.

The term "phone e-commerce site" is just a name. I designed the components to be versatile and usable separately.
