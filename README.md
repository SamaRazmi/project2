# **This is the second project done by Samaneh Razmi (Sama_Flower).**

## Project Overview

**This project is about E-Commerce site, especially phone E-Commerce. Anyway, you can expand it to anything you want.**

# Tech Marketplace App

Welcome to the Tech Marketplace App! This platform serves as a marketplace for buying and selling tech gadgets, offering a wide range of devices such as smartphones, laptops, cameras, and other electronic devices.

## Key Features

- **Product Listings:** Users can list their tech gadgets for sale, providing details such as device type, brand, colors, specifications, condition, price, and time on the market.
- **Product Browsing:** Browse through a comprehensive list of tech products available on the marketplace, featuring details like type, brand, condition, and price. Users have the ability to filter products based on their preferences.
- **Product Detail Page:** Access detailed information about each product by clicking on it, including additional specifications and the option to add the item to the cart. Products added to the user's cart are automatically removed from the marketplace (note: due to the lack of a secure purchase system, this action simulates a reservation).
- **Device Auction:** Engage in device auctions where users can place bids for devices and compete with others on the price. Devices are sold at their highest bidding price, unless they are added to a cart at the listed price.


//Unfortunately, my default group (group 7) did not cooperate, and I completed the project independently using previous information and course materials.

The term "phone e-commerce site" is just a name. I designed the components to be versatile and usable separately.
